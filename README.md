# Challenge 4 School District Analysis
## Project Overview
There was evidence of academic dishonesty in some of the data that was previously given to us, specifically in the ninth grade math and reading scores of Thomas High School. Since there was previously a school district analysis performed already, what is required is to eliminated the ninth grade scores of Thomas High School and adjust the analysis accordingly.

## Summary
### District Summary
The scores and passing percent in the district summary all fall, with reading falling the least. Compared to other summaries, this is the most significant, likely due to the fact that Thomas High School has higher than average passing rates and is second in the district overall.

### School Summary
On the school summary level, Thomas High School's ranking is still second in the district, though all scores and passing rates fell, except for the average reading score, which rose very slightly.

### Categories Summary
In terms of the spending category $631-645, the school-sized medium category, and the school type "charter", all scores and passing rates fell, though the fall was nearly insignificant. This was likely for several reasons. One, for the charter schools, they mostly tend to all have higher than average passing rates and scores, so even with the loss of the ninth grade scores at Thomas High School, there is a minimal impact. Two, all of the medium-sized school are also charter schools, so again, the drop is minimal. In terms of the spending category ($631-645) we see a slightly higher, though also almost negligible drop in all categories. The reason for this lack of impact has to do with student volume; Thomas High School's number of students is less than 15% of the total four schools in this category, thus a loss of a portion of the smallest school will not impact the rest of these scores greatly.
